# Haiku's Visual Novel Engine
A roblox module that allows you to create a Visual Novel experience in Roblox.
Currently features BGM handling, sprite handling, subject handling and a friendly dialogue scripting system!

## Planned Features
- Transition effects between scenes.
- Niche features from Key Visual Novels. (Such as BGM fading when voices are speaking, etc.)

## Usage
Use the model on roblox. (https://create.roblox.com/marketplace/asset/15754053266) Place the module somwehere in StarterGui. From there you can open the "coreVNHandler" script, scroll down to the "dialogueScript" function and use it.

## Documentation
For now you can find information about functions in the "coreVNHandler" script and the "vnEngineModule".
